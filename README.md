## :mega: Description

This GitHub repository contains the technical test for TicTacTrip, which involves implementing and deploying a REST API that justifies a given text. The implementation must follow certain constraints, including the use of a unique token-based authentication mechanism and a rate limit of 80,000 words per day for the justify endpoint. The code must be written in Node.js/TypeScript and should not use any external library for justification. By meeting these requirements, the API will be able to justify text while ensuring security, rate limiting, and scalability.
